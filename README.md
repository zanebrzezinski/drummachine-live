#React Drum Machine

[React Drum Machine](http://drummachine.zanebrzezinski.com)

A drum machine built in Rails, React, and Javascript.

Instructions

Click Play to start the sequencer.  Each of the 16 buttons along the bottom can
clicked to add a sound to that step in the sequence.  The sound can be selected
with the instrument select buttons in the middle of the drum machine.  Each sound
has an individual volume slider beneath it's instrument select button.  

The global tempo can be set with the tempo slider in the upper right hand corner.  Individual patterns
can be named in the top right, and saved to the browser cookie for later recall with the
save button.  Try making a few patterns and switching between them on the fly!
